The purpose of this project is to design and implement a new standard library
for Coq. It will follow a clean slate approach, not aiming at compatibility with
the current library, which will be maintained separately.

This project is coordinated by @maximedenes and can be discussed and followed
at: https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/7711 and
https://github.com/orgs/coq/projects/1

We foresee several stages:
- Preliminary clean-up and infrastructure work
- Implementation of prelude and basic tactics
- Experimentation on existing libraries (for example, to compare canonical
  structures and type classes)
- Implementation of the first components of the library
- Extensions of the library

The project is currently in its first phase. Questions and discussions are
welcome at this stage. External code contribution will be integrated during the
last two phases.
